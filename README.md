# Classification_Clustering_withR
Some Classification and Clustering methods

I used a Telecom dataset, which included 3333 observations at total and 483 of them were churners. The whole dataset can be found at this (Kaggle Page)[https://www.kaggle.com/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset]. 

In classification part I used;

- Tree Based Models (Decision Tree – Random Forest)	
- Naïve Bayes using Cross Validation Method	
   - Naïve Bayes using Balanced Sampling & Separate Sampling Methods	
- SVM using Cross Validation Method	
   - SVM using Balanced Sampling & Separate Sampling Methods	
- Random Forest using Cross Validation Method	
- K-Nearest Neighbors using Cross Validation Method	

In clustering part I used;

- Kmeans
- Hierarchical Clustering
